I'm a soydev writing programs in [the best programming language, even according to Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa55RKWZxxI)!
But beware, I rarely come up with anything useful. The best I can do is a not even properly functioning discord-rpc program which displays music playing in cmus on your Discord profile. All (most?) of my other repositories are useless and/or horribly broken pieces of crap.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on existing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun, small projects (see my PR history)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with everything
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord (MineClashTVYT#1337), Twitter, or email if you're a boomer
