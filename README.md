I'm a soydev writing programs in [the best programming language, even according to Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa55RKWZxxI)!
But beware, I rarely come up with anything useful. The best I can do is a not even properly functioning discord-rpc program which displays music playing in cmus on your Discord profile. All of my other repositories are useless and/or horribly broken pieces of crap.
